# Snake-Water-Gun-Game-python-project
# Description:
A console-based implementation of the traditional “Snake-Water-Gun” game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors). Users input their choice (s, w, or g) and the computer randomly selects one too. The winner is decided based on predefined rules.

# Key Concepts:

* Use of random.choice()
* Mapping logic with dictionaries
* Conditional branching for game outcomes

# Improvement Suggestion:

* Fix typos: "sanke" → "snake", "its drow" → "it's a draw"
* Use better error handling for invalid inputs.
